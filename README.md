## Objectives:
* Create a web app of Content Management System type
* Create a Real State standar app
* Enhance personal branding for Sergio Escudero (Real State agent)

## Achieves:
We built our own MVC micro-Framwork. We based it on Laravel and Django Framework concepts. We integrated some external libraries from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) (illuminate/database, kint-php/kint, twig/twig, altorouter/altorouter and verot/class.upload.php) , as well as we made our system for adapt those libraries outputs in order to make it easier to use, taking the best of those libraries to achieve complicated tasks. At the end, we have our own micro-framework up and running in a real project, using only PHP.
